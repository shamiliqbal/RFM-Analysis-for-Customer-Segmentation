Project Showcase: RFM Analysis for Customer Segmentation 

Iâ€™m excited to share my recent data science project where I applied RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

What I did:

Calculated Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores for each customer.

Assigned scores from 1 to 5 to quantify customer engagement and value.

Created customer segments to identify high-value, loyal, and at-risk customers.

Provided actionable sales insights to improve targeted marketing efforts.

Key Takeaways:

Identified top customers driving the most revenue and loyalty.

Highlighted customer segments requiring personalized marketing strategies.

Enabled data-driven decisions to boost sales and customer retention.

Improved understanding of customer purchasing patterns and value.

This project enhanced my skills in data analysis and generating impactful business insights through customer segmentation.
